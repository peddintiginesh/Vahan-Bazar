**Problem statement :**

Build a two-wheeler marketplace web app where users can browse, compare, and sell bikes, scooters, and EVs.

**Reason to Choose :**
Buying or selling a bike today takes too much time. People have to switch between multiple apps for price comparisons, EMI calculations,or even booking test rides. Sellers also struggle to reach genuine buyers. We wanted to bring everything into one simple platform – and that’s how Vahan Bazar was born.

    •	Storage: PostgreSQL (structured data) + file storage for images.
    
**Implementation Plan :**

        1.	Initial setup – React + Node.js + PostgreSQL environment.
        
        2.	 Develop core modules (Auth, Sell Bike, Browse, EMI, Test Ride).
        3.	 Integration of frontend & backend APIs.
        4.	 Testing all features with sample data.
        5.	 Final build deployment (ready for hosting).
**Deployment & Scalability :**

    •	Deployment Plan: Can be hosted on AWS or Azure.
    
    •	Scalability: System can add dealer dashboards, AI-driven recommendations, and online payments in future updates.
