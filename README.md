**Problem statement :**

Build a two-wheeler marketplace web app where users can browse, compare, and sell bikes, scooters, and EVs.

**Reason to Choose :**
Buying or selling a bike today takes too much time. People have to switch between multiple apps for price comparisons, EMI calculations,or even booking test rides. Sellers also struggle to reach genuine buyers. We wanted to bring everything into one simple platform – and that’s how Vahan Bazar was born.
