# üöÄ Vahan Bazar
## Smart Two-Wheeler Marketplace
## Key Features


### Problem statement :

Build a two-wheeler marketplace web app where users can browse, compare, and sell bikes, scooters, and EVs.

### Reason to Choose :
Buying or selling a bike today takes too much time. People have to switch between multiple apps for price comparisons, EMI calculations,or even booking test rides. Sellers also struggle to reach genuine buyers. We wanted to bring everything into one simple platform ‚Äì and that‚Äôs how Vahan Bazar was born.

<p> The frontend (React + Tailwind) communicates with our Node.js/Express backend via REST APIs.
PostgreSQL stores structured data like bike listings, while image files are kept in storage.
Background services handle notifications like test ride confirmations.</p>

### Technology Stack:

‚Ä¢	**Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
            
‚Ä¢	**Backend**: Node.js + Express
            
‚Ä¢	**Database**: PostgreSQL

### Algorithms & Models :
‚Ä¢	No ML model is used in this version.

‚Ä¢	Filtering & comparison are handled using custom algorithms in JavaScript.

‚Ä¢	EMI calculation is done with a simple financial formula.

### Data Handling :

‚Ä¢	**Data Sources**: Manually added bike details & seller inputs.
    
‚Ä¢	**Preprocessing**: Data is validated on both frontend & backend.
    
‚Ä¢	**Storage**: PostgreSQL (structured data) + file storage for images.
    
### Implementation Plan :

1.	Initial setup ‚Äì React + Node.js + PostgreSQL environment.
        
2.	 Develop core modules (Auth, Sell Bike, Browse, EMI, Test Ride).
   
3.	 Integration of frontend & backend APIs.

4.	 Testing all features with sample data.
	 
5.	 Final build deployment.
### Deployment & Scalability :

‚Ä¢	**Deployment Plan**: Can be hosted on AWS or Azure.
    
‚Ä¢	**Scalability**: System can add dealer dashboards, AI-driven recommendations, and online payments in future updates.
